                <h4>Unseen. Unloved. Sometimes - even killed.</h4>
                <p>For most wildlife, these are something they seldomly face. But for the others, these are 
                    their daily truth - judged and stereotyped. Most people fear them, and others go as far as hurting them and killing them in the 
                    process. They say they do it out of fear, that these creatures are dangerous and that what they did is a form of self-protection. 
                    But the truth is far from that. In reality, these beings thought to be deadly are not at all harmful and most probably, are 
                    harmless. When these beings bite, the number one reason for it would be that it's being defensive. You might have unawarely harmed 
                    it, thus triggering its defense mechanism. </p>
                <p>To prevent such accidents from happening, it is important for us people to learn their patterns and behaviors. With this website, we 
                    can help spread awareness on wildlife handling and unnecessary killing of these unseen beings. </p>
